	<h4>Indoctrinate</h4>
	<p>Since a very young age the education system has have been psychologically manipulating all of us! in 1903 John D Rockefeller funded the general education board with a famous quote "<em>I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers.</em>" the school system was designed to <em>endoctrinate young students from day one</em> through the general education board by teaching you to <em>obey authority, follow the rules, memorize not think.</em> Then after highscool get into <strong>debt</strong> with student loans so you can go to collage/university for further endoctrination and get a 9AM-5PM job for some coreration. The whole system was created around you being a <em>thoughtless, mindless, working class slave.</em> For if everyone was a millionaire who would work?</p>

	<h4>Evil</h4>
    <p>Imagine a life of total enslavement, by modern day digital slavery, through a corrupt and evil globalist agenda. Your bank accounts, well their just numbers on a screen, meaningless literally! This is becuase for every $100 a customer has in his account, that branch will carry $3 of the $100 and use the other $97 for their own investment needs.</p>

	<h4>Tax</h4>
	<p>Meanwhile in your<a href = https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/bank-accounts/savings-accounts/compare-savings-accounts.html> RBC</a> high intrest savings account, you are only getting a %0.75 return on investment (ROI) while the major banking cartels are lending it out to other customers and charging much higher intrest, just think credit cards, line of credits, mortgages these devices are used to enslave and entrap you with such high intrest on credit cards, lines of credit, ect. upwards of 28% intrest or more. Why do you think they try and scare you with your credit score, This is because this very way of thinking is programmed by this corrupt system for the peasents and the plebeians. Get up at 3:45AM to be at work for 6AM be there for 10 hours or more per day, then at the end of your 2 weeks you automatically paid your taxes to the government like the good slave you are! When you buy something with the money that you were already taxed on, you pay federal taxes and provincial taxes (gst+pst=hst(B.C.)), but wait when you buy fuel you also have to pay a carbon tax! When you sell your assets there is also a capital gains tax of 50%, this is truly highway robbery! Not to mention raising cost of food, all these factors combined it's no wonder the average Canadian is struggling so bad!</p>

   <h4>Devaluation</h4>
   <p>On the 15th of August 1971. The U.S. President Richard Nixion ended the Bretton Woods agreement by ending the dollars convertability to gold, depegging the U.S Dollar from gold to oil. From a fix exchange rate system that the IMF (International Monetary Fund) oversaw, to a system of floating exchange rates (fait) controlled by individual countries, central banks and goverments. These entities print false money through things like quantitative easing which involves central banks creating new money eletronically to purchase large qantities of finacial assets such as but not limited to goverments bonds. The central banks buy the bonds or other assests from commercial banks and institutions paying with the newly created money, directly injecting the cash into the finacial system (MV=PY). So imagine you buy some vodka from your friend to find out he watered it down, by over half! the alcohol content has dropped tremendously! Same thing with the value of your precious fait that you have work so hard at hording away in some savings account doing nothing for you other than <strong><em>losing value</em></strong> while intrest occured is less than the raise of inflation!</p>
